# Must-read papers on Recommender System

This repository provides a list of papers including **surveys**, **classical recommender system**, **social recommender system**, **deep learing-based recommender system** and **cold start problem in recommender system**. 

It contains *a set of comprehensive surveys* about recommender system, collaborative filtering, social recommender system and deep learning based recommender system, *a set of famous recommendation papers* which make predictions with some classic models and *social recommendation papers* which utilize trust/social information in order to alleviate the sparsity of ratings data, and *a set of papers to build a recommender system with deep learning techniques*. Last, there are also *some papers specifically dealing with the cold start problems inherent in collaborative filtering*.

The order of papers is sorted by year.
