It contains *a set of comprehensive surveys* about recommender system, collaborative filtering, social recommender system and deep learning based recommender system, *a set of famous recommendation papers* which make predictions with some classic models and *social recommendation papers* which utilize trust/social information in order to alleviate the sparsity of ratings data, and *a set of papers to build a recommender system with deep learning techniques*. Next, there are also *some papers specifically dealing with the cold start problems inherent in collaborative filtering*. Then, we collect some *hashing techniques for recommender system* in order to training efficiently. Last, there are also some articles about *exploration and exploitation problems* in recommendation.
